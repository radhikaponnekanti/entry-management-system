#summary Business Process Definition and Requirements
<wiki:toc max_depth='5'/>
=1.0 Business Objectives for Process=

   The traditional process of allowing a visitor into an office building is to verify the authentication of the vistor manually. This process involves security personnel of the building.

   The Entry Management System performs this validation by using a software application without the presence of the staff. This system verifies the identity proof and reason of visit, issues a visitor pass based on the accuracy of the information provided by the visitor, and then allows the visitor into the building.

=2.0 Business Requirements=

  * System should hold the details of all the employees working in the building.
  * Visitor should be able to enter all the details like his name, address, phone number, reason of visit and person of contact into the system.
  * System should verify the identity proof of the visitor.
  * System should verify with the person of contact whether the reason of visit entered by the visitor is true.
  * System should be able to print the visitor's pass and allow the visitor inside.
  * System should store all the information related to the visitor for further use.
  * System should generate a report with the details of the visitors on that particular day.
  * System should be able to generate a report with the number of visitors for a selected period.

==2.2 New Process Requirements==
====System Requirements====
The application should run on all operating systems. System should also be available for use 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

====Reporting Requirements====
Daily report on the number of visitors should be generated and stored.

====Data Requirements====
All the details of the employees of the building and visitors.

====Security Requirements=====
All the data captured should be secure.
  * Administrator should have high level access, to manage the data.
  * Visitors should have low level access, just to be able to enter their details.

====Personnel Requirements====

==2.3 Business Impact==
By using a software application, the efficiency of handling visitors into the premises increases. It speeds up the process of verification and reduces the chance of human errors.
===2.3.1 Metrics to Measure Business Impact===
  * No manpower needed
  * Details of a previous visitor will be readily available

===2.3.2 Business Dependencies===
  * System is dependent on the details of the employees stored.
  * Visitors should enter accurate data into the system.

===2.3.3 Business Risks===
  * Visitors face difficulty using the system.
  * System is unavailable affecting the entry of the visitors.

==2.4 Technology Impact==
  * Scanners, printers and camera are used

===2.4.1 Technology Dependencies===
  * Up-to-date working computer
  * Scanner, printer and camera in working condition

===2.4.2 Technology Risks===
  * Computer crashes
  * System is down
  * Scanner, printer or camera not working
  * Security breach

=3.0 Assumptions=
The following assumptions are essential to the previous business impact predictions.
  * System has a user-friendly interface
  * Visitors have basic computer knowledge to enter their details into the system
=4.0 Issues=
Efficiency of the system depends on the visitor's input and stored details of the employees.

=5.0 Project Success Criteria=
  * System should be available in a month.
  * Requirements should be in clear and understandable documentation.
