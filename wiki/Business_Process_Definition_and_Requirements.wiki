=1.0 Business Objectives for Process=

   The traditional process of allowing a visitor into a premises is to verify the authentication of the vistor manually. This process involves security personnel of the premises.

   The Entry Management System performs this validation by using a software application without the presence of the staff. This system verifies the identity proof and purpose of visit, issues a visitor pass based on the accuracy of the information provided by the visitor, and then allows the visitor into premises.

=2.0 Business Requirements=

  * System should hold the details of all the employees working in the premises.
  * Visitor should be able to enter all the details of the purpose of visit into the system.
  * System should verify the identity proof of the visitor.
  * System should verify with the person of contact whether the purpose of visit entered by the visitor is true.
  * System should be able to print the visitors' pass and allow the visitor inside.
  * System should store all the information related to the visitor for further use.
  * System should generate a report with the details of the visitors on that particular day.
  * System should be able to generate a report with the number of visitors for a selected period.
